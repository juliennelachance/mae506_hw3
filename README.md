Assignment 3: Root finding and automated testing

First I will debug the provided files newton.py and functions.py. 
Then I will add tests to check newton.py and functions.py for additional bugs. 

Later, I will implement a new feature within the Newton class to allow for the 
specification of an analytic Jacobian. Corresponding tests will be added. 
I will also create an additional condition for checking the approximated root,
and create appropriate tests for this. 

GitHub will be used to manage code.
